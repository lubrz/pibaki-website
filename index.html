        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>Everything parents want to know about Pibaki</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-container">
        
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Is my data safe?</summary>
            <p>Absolutely. Pibaki does not collect any personal information. All data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted to servers. We don't have analytics, tracking, or any third-party services. Your family's privacy is our top priority.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can I use Pibaki for multiple children?</summary>
            <p>Yes! You can create unlimited piggy banks, one for each child. Each child gets their own personalized space with custom avatars, tasks, and savings goals.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do the tokens represent real money?</summary>
            <p>You decide! When setting up, you choose your currency and how much each token is worth (e.g., 1 token = $0.10). This lets you connect virtual rewards to real allowances or just use it as a teaching tool without actual money.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How do parent controls work?</summary>
            <p>Parents set up a secure PIN (and optionally Face ID/Touch ID) to access editing features. Children can view their piggy banks and progress, but only parents can add tokens, create tasks, or modify goals. This keeps everything safe while letting kids feel ownership.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What if I forget my PIN?</summary>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you forget your PIN and haven't enabled Face ID/Touch ID, there is no way to recover it. You will need to uninstall and reinstall the app, which will delete all your data. We recommend enabling Face ID/Touch ID as a backup authentication method when setting up parent controls. This way, you can always access the app even if you forget your PIN.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Does Pibaki work offline?</summary>
            <p>Yes! Pibaki works completely offline. No internet connection is required. All your family's data stays on your device.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can I install Pibaki on multiple devices?</summary>
            <p>Currently, Pibaki stores all data locally on each device independently. This means if you install the app on two different devices (e.g., mom's iPhone and dad's iPhone), they will have separate data and won't sync with each other. We recommend choosing one primary device for managing your family's piggy banks. If you use iCloud backup, you can restore your data when switching to a new device.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What are the monthly fees?</summary>
            <p>You can optionally enable a small monthly "fee" (like real banks charge) to teach kids about account maintenance. This is completely customizable and can be disabled. It's just a teaching tool, not a real charge.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can my child track progress toward goals?</summary>
            <p>Yes! Kids can create savings goals (like "New Toy" or "Bike") and transfer tokens toward them. They'll see visual progress bars and get a celebration when goals are reached. Completed goals are saved in a special "Achievements" section.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What happens to the data if I delete the app?</summary>
            <p>All data will be permanently deleted from your device. Since we don't store anything on servers, we cannot recover it. If you want to preserve your data, make sure your device is backed up to iCloud before deletion.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Is there a limit to tasks or goals?</summary>
            <p>No limits! Create as many tasks, savings goals, and piggy banks as you need for your family.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Are there monthly reports?</summary>
            <p>Yes! At the end of each month, Pibaki generates a report showing token earnings, spending, task completion rates, and achievement badges. It's a great way to review progress with your child.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What platforms does Pibaki support?</summary>
            <p>Currently, Pibaki is available for iOS (iPhone and iPad) running iOS 16 or later. Android support may come in the future based on demand.</p>
